The agricultural marketing apparatus of the state of Odisha consists of Odisha State Agricultural Marketing Board (OSAM Board)
and Directorate of Agricultural Marketing. The present agricultural marketing system of the state is governed by the
Odisha State Agricultural Produce Marketing Act, which came into force back in the year 1956. Under the present dispensation,
there are 66 Regulated Market Committees (RMCs) functioning under the supervision and control of the OSAM. 
The board is entrusted with the task of superintendence and control over the R.M.Cs to ensure their efficient and effective functioning.
A Regulated Market aims at realization of three major objectives, such as Ensuring correct weighment for the products of the farmers,

convergence approach with related departments and agencies for development of agricultural marketing. Preparation and implementation of
district agricultural marketing plan in collaboration with line depts. and support of district administration. Fictionalization of
